<p> This is the best <strong>Vegan Alfredo Sauce Ever!</strong> Easy to make with just a handful of ingredients and ready in 15 minutes or less. No one will know it’s vegan! </p>
<h1> Ingredients:</h1>
     <ul>
        <li><strong> Raw cashews: </strong> They are the base for the delicious creamy sauce. You can try using slivered almonds or sunflower seeds instead, but it won’t quite be the same. </li>
        <li> <strong> Nutritional yeast: </strong> For a cheesy taste. May omit if you don’t like it.</li>
        <li> <strong> Onion: </strong> One medium red oninon.</li>
        <li> <strong> Garlic: </strong> use freshly minced garlic for the best flavor.</li>
        <li> <strong> Unsweetened almond milk: </strong> For garnish. </li>
        <li> <strong> Olive Oil: </strong> For sautéing the onions and garlic. </li>
        <li> <strong> A high powered blender for best results : </strong> I highly recommend a Vitamix or other powerful blender. A regular blender can possibly be used, but the sauce won’t get as creamy.</li>
        <li> <strong> Lime Juice:</strong> use freshly squeezed lime/lemon juice. </li>
        </ul>
     
  <h1> How to Make vegan alfredo sauce</h1>
      <ol>
        <li> Soak the cashews for 5 minutes in hot water. I simply use my tea kettle to boil water, and pour it over the cashews in a glass measuring cup. </li>
        <li> Sauté 1/2 an onion and 6 cloves of garlic in a small pan for 5 minutes.  </li>
        <li> Add the drained cashews, onion/garlic, almond milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice and salt to a high powered blender and blend until creamy and smooth. </li>
        <li> Stir in the tomatoes and mix.</li>
        <li> Add sauce to pasta, mix and warm if needed. That’s it!   </li>
      </ol>
